    <p> Hello! I am a Master's student in the department of Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) at the University of Washington. I also obtained a B.S HCDE Spring 2017. What I love about being in UX is the opportunity to learn and understand people,
      either people that I collaborate with or designing for, with various backgrounds and experiences. It makes me feel a little bit more connected to the billions of other humans that are sharing Mother Earth.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, my hobbies are all over the place. I like to read, crotchet, play video games, sit at a cafe to people watch and the list goes on. If my wallet can handle it, I love to travel (who doesn't?)! </p>
