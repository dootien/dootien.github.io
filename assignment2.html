        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p> With the shapes already decided from last assignment, the first step was figuring out how to use Rhino and Grasshopper. Rhino was not too hard to learn because I had experience using it. Grasshopper, on the other hand, was a new look and took some time to get used to.</p>

        <p> The hardest part about Grasshopper was figuring out how the different aspects worked together but with the help of Google and Nadya's video, I was able to understand to use it like building blocks of components and that helped me visualize it better.</p>

        <img src="units.png">
        <p>First, I made the same shape and dimensions that I had for the last assignment. I used my caliper to get the exact dimensions of the shape and used that as inputs in Grasshopper. The first test cut I had was with cardboard because I wanted to see if the file works and that things are in the correct dimensions and units. One trouble that I got into was that the units did not transfer correctly from Rhino to Illustrator. I immediately realized that it was most likely a settings option because I specifically measured it and checked the units to make sure it was correct. The solution was just to check that the units are converting the as the same.</p>

        <img src="paper-cut.png">
        <p> The test cut came out fine so I started exploring with stock paper material. Using the same Rhino/Grasshopper file, I just changed the rectangle to be the thickness of the paper, which was very thin. It was a simple change on Grasshopper. The issue that I encountered with cutting the paper was figuring out the print settings! I consulted with the staff and they recommended to have fast speed but low power. I started with speed of 90 and 10 power. The power was not enough to make a full cut so the pieces would not detach. I kept increasing the power by 5 until the pieces were completely cut through. I ended up finding that power of 20 and speed of 90 was perfect. </p>

        <p>The paper I used was a little thicker than regular but it was still too thin to hold on it's own. So it is not the ideal material to build 3D sculptures. But I played around with the pieces and it actually looks pretty cool as a 2D abstract art.</p>


        <p>I also explored cutting with a mat board because I saw that there were a lot of extra materials in the stock pile at the Mill and I really liked how the mat board felt. </p>

        <p>I had less trouble figuring out the print settings for the mat board because I just followed the recommended print settings that the Mill had. It did get a little bit smokey but nothing was burnt. While I was cutting the mat board, a group of new students were getting a tour at the Mill and I got to show off my skills :).</p>

        <p>An obstacle that I encountered was figuring out the press fit cut dimensions so that it is a snug fit because the thickness was much more than what I was used to. I just tried the traditional method of reducing it by a few milimeters from the actual thickness until I got the snug fit I wanted. I went from 5mm to 4.8mm.</p>

        <p>I was curious about making some abstract art combining all the different thickness materials so I used the paper and cut it in copies of the mat board's dimensions because the paper is not strong enough to support mat boards sticking on it but vice versa would work.I ended up running out of time to cut the coardboard...</p>
        
        <h3>Other Challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the challenges that I had was that I forgot to save the Grasshopper file so I had to redo the file, which wasn't so hard when you get the mechanics down. I didn't realized that Rhino didn't save the grasshopper with the Rhino file. </p>
        
        <h2>Kit Design</h2>

        <p> Each material has 6 pieces. The mat board and cardboard pieces can fit within their press fit cut and stands. You can assemble it in many ways. In my previous designs, I had the two circles for the bulb but for this one, I decided to not use the bulb (I did laser cut it) because I thought it was restraining the different ways that it could be formed together.</p>

        <p>The paper material has to be laid down. You can simply connect the pieces in a circular form and it will become a nice geometry shape!</p>
