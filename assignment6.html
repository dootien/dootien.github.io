        <p>To honor my zodiac animal, I made a piggy mold. I used Rhino to make the CAD because for some reason, it is more intuitive for me to use. I started out making a full pig's head and then I cut it in half so that I will save time to 3D print and also I didn't need the whole head. I decided to 3D print because frankly, I am a broke grad student and didn't want to spend anymore money on this one assignment.</p>

        <p>I was playing with the idea of potentially just printing out the pig's face and then dip it in a silicone mix bed but then I figured better safe than sorry so I created a box around it. </p>

        <img src="hw6/infill.png">
        <p>To be honest, the most trouble I had doing this assignment was still printing!!! WHY! I kept having problems when I 3D print and this time, I learned that having proper infills is important when you model comes out of a shape because my box had a bunch of holes since I adjusted the infill to 10% but also had it as fast honeycomb. I changed it to 20% with rectilinear and it covered the top layer pretty well. Also, selecting the correct profile in Simplify3D is critical to making sure the file works into the 3D printer. There were just a bunch of little accidents that could have occurred but good thing, I was watching it for a while before I left to make sure it kicks off correctly! </p>

        <p>Alas, the mold is done!</p>

        <p>The next step was to make the silicone mixture and pour it into the mold. This part was so messy but using the ratio of 1:1 turned out nicely. Although the instructions said it was supposed to turn lavendar... it was more like blueish. </p>

        <p>I really like this part. It was so satisfying to watch it cover the mold nicely. I left it away from reach for 6 hours.</p>

        <p>The mold came out nicely! One thing that I was concerned about is when I cast the plaster, it would not flow into the ears since it is tucked away.</p>

        <p>The next step was to cast it with plaster. One problem I encountered was that I mixed the plaster wrong. For some reason, I thought that ratio was 1:1 so it came out really runny. So I consulted slack and tried 3:1 (plaster:water) and it had more consistency. </p>
        
        <p>My worries were confirmed when the pig came out with missing part of its ears. At first I thought that it was because I peeled it off too hard so it clip off the ears but after 2 molds, I think it is because the plaster didn't go into the ears. For the next molds, I started to move the mold in circular motion after pouring in the plaster so that it would flow into the ear edges. This sort of worked but for some reason, one of the ears is just kind of wacky. I think something I would have to keep in mind next time is to make the model more connected because the ear was just pointing out too much.</p>
