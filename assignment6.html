        <p>To honor my zodiac animal, I made a piggy mold. I used Rhino to make the CAD because for some reason, it is more intuitive for me to use. I started out making a full pig's head and then I cut it in half so that I will save time to 3D print and also I didn't need the whole head. I decided to 3D print because frankly, I am a broke grad student and didn't want to spend anymore money on this one assignment.</p>

        <img src="hw6/pig2.png">

        <p>I was playing with the idea of potentially just printing out the pig's face and then dip it in a silicone mix bed but then I figured better safe than sorry so I created a box around it. </p>

        <img src="hw6/infill.png">
        <p>To be honest, the most trouble I had doing this assignment was still printing!!! WHY! I kept having problems when I 3D print and this time, I learned that having proper infills is important when you model comes out of a shape because my box had a bunch of holes since I adjusted the infill to 10% but also had it as fast honeycomb. I changed it to 20% with rectilinear and it covered the top layer pretty well. Also, selecting the correct profile in Simplify3D is critical to making sure the file works into the 3D printer. </p>

        <p>Alas, the mold is done!</p>
