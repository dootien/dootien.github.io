        <h3> Ideation</h3>

        <p> For this assignment, I wanted to make a flower construction kit. First, I start sketching out different shapes for the petals, starting with a circle and then exploring other shapes to make more interesting looking petals.</p>
        
        <img src="petal6.png">
        <p>For the cut fit, I started with the thickness of my cardboard which was 2.7 mm. I did a test cut to try the fitting and see if the structure would survive a gentle jiggle. Even though the fit was fine, I was concerned that it was not snug enough in some places because the cardboard's thickness was not consistent throughout so I changed the thickness of the cut by 0.1mm each time and found that at 2.5mm the fit was snug enough. I also made the petals bigger because I thought it was too small. </p>

        <p>For the bulb, I just cut two circles and fit them together. </p>

        <h3> Other Challenges</h3>
        <p>The biggest obstacle that I encountered during this assignment was getting my file to print correctly. I kept receiving "position error" from the laser cutting machine and after consulting the staff, the solution was to unchecked the "Center Engraving" box in "preferences".</p>
